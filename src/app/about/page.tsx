            <p>
              At Inkless Is More, we take a personalized approach to tattoo removal. We understand that every tattoo and every client is unique, which is why we create customized treatment plans tailored to your specific needs and goals.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Our Technology</h2>
            <p>
              We use the advanced Picosureâ“‡ laser technology, which delivers ultra-short pulses of energy to the tattoo ink. This technology can effectively treat a wider range of ink colors and is often able to remove tattoos with fewer treatments compared to traditional lasers.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Our Team</h2>

            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight">Our Promise</h2>
